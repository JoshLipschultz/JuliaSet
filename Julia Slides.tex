\section{\scshape Preliminaries}
\subsection{frame 1}
\begin{frame}


A quick recap of last week:

\pause

\begin{defn}
The \textsl{stable set} of a a complex polynomial $P: \mathbb{C} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$, denoted $S(P)$, is the complement of $J(C)$.
\end{defn}

\pause

\begin{defn}
An orbit is \textsl{bounded} if there exists a $K$ such that $|Q_c^{\circ n}(z)| < K$ for all $n$. Otherwise the orbit is \textsl{unbounded}.
\end{defn}

\pause

\begin{rmk}
The points of $S^1$ are \textsl{supersensitive} under $Q_{0}$. That is, any open ball around $z \in S^1$ has the property that $\bigcup_{n=0}^\infty Q_0^{\circ n} (z) = \mathbb{C} \setminus \{p\}$ for at most one point $p$.
\end{rmk}

\end{frame}

\subsection{frame 2}
\begin{frame}

\begin{defn}
The Julia Set $J_c$ is the boundary of the filled Julia set $K_c$. (The filled Julia set is the set of bounded points of $Q_c$.) We could alternatively define $J_c$ as the closure of the set of repelling points of $Q_c$..
\end{defn}

\pause


\begin{rmk}
For the quadratic map $Q_0(z) = z^2$ we saw chaotic behavior only on $S^1$ by angle doubling ($\theta \rightarrow 2\theta$). We also saw that $|Q_0(z)| \rightarrow \infty$ for all $|z| > 1$ and $|Q_0(z)| \rightarrow 0$ for all $|z| < 1$.
\end{rmk}

\pause


\begin{rmk}
Finally, we learned that for $Q_{-2}(z) = z^2 - 2$, we have $J_2 = K_2 = [-2, 2]$, so any $z \in \mathbb{C} \ [-2,2] \rightarrow \infty$ as we compose $Q_{-2}(z)$ infinitely many times. 
\end{rmk}

\vspace{2cm}

\begin{theorem}
If $|c|$ is sufficiently large, $\Lambda$, the set of points whose entire forward orbits lie within the circle $|z|=|c|$, is a Cantor set on which $Q_c$ is topologically conjugate to the shift map on two symbols. All points in $\mathbb{C} - \Lambda$ tend to $\infty$ under iteration of $Q_c$. Hence, $J_c=K_c$.
\end{theorem}
