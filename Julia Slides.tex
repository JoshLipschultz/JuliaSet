\subsection{frame 1}
\begin{frame}


\pause

\begin{defn}
The \textsl{stable set} of a a complex polynomial $P: \mathbb{C} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$, denoted $S(P)$, is the complement of $J(C)$.
\end{defn}

\pause

\begin{defn}
An orbit is \textsl{bounded} if there exists a $K$ such that $|Q_c^{\circ n}(z)| < K$ for all $n$. Otherwise the orbit is \textsl{unbounded}.
\end{defn}

\pause

\begin{rmk}
The points of $S^1$ are \textsl{supersensitive} under $Q_{0}$. That is, any open ball around $z \in S^1$ has the property that $\bigcup_{n=0}^\infty Q_0^{\circ n} (z) = \mathbb{C} \setminus \{p\}$ for at most one point $p$.
\end{rmk}

\end{frame}

\subsection{frame 2}
\begin{frame}

\begin{defn}
The Julia Set $J_c$ is the boundary of the filled Julia set $K_c$. (The filled Julia set is the set of bounded points of $Q_c$.) We could alternatively define $J_c$ as the closure of the set of repelling points of $Q_c$.
\end{defn}

\pause


\begin{rmk}
For the quadratic map $Q_0(z) = z^2$ we saw chaotic behavior only on $S^1$ by angle doubling ($\theta \rightarrow 2\theta$). We also saw that $|Q_0(z)| \rightarrow \infty$ for all $|z| > 1$ and $|Q_0(z)| \rightarrow 0$ for all $|z| < 1$.
\end{rmk}

\pause


\begin{rmk}
Finally, we learned that for $Q_{-2}(z) = z^2 - 2$, we have $J_2 = K_2 = [-2, 2]$, so any $z \in \mathbb{C} \setminus [-2,2] \rightarrow \infty$ as we compose $Q_{-2}(z)$ infinitely many times. 
\end{rmk}

\section{\scshape Cantor Construction}


\subsection{frame 2}
\begin{frame}

\begin{itemize}
\item Goal: discuss and prove parts of:
\end{itemize}

\vspace{1cm}

\begin{theorem}
If $|c|$ is sufficiently large, $\Lambda$, the set of points whose entire forward orbits lie within the circle $|z|=|c|$, is a Cantor set on which $Q_c$ is topologically conjugate to the shift map on two symbols. All points in $\mathbb{C} - \Lambda$ tend to $\infty$ under iteration of $Q_c$. Hence, $J_c=K_c$.
\end{theorem}

\end{frame}


\subsection{frame 2}
\begin{frame}

\begin{theorem} [The Escape Criterion]
Suppose $2 < |c| \le |z|$. Then we have that $|Q_c^n(z)| \rightarrow \infty$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
We use the triangle inequality to get the following estimate:
\begin{equation}
    |Q_c^n(z)| \geq |z|^2 - |c| \geq |z|^2 - |z| = |z|(|z|-1)
\end{equation}
Since $|z| > 2$, we know that $|z|-1>1$, so there exists $\lambda > 0$ such that 
\begin{equation}
    |Q_c^n(z)| \geq (1+\lambda)^n|z|
\end{equation}
Since $|z|$ is fixed and $(1+\lambda)^n$ grows arbitrarily large, $|Q_c^n(z)|$ also grows arbitrarily large, as desired.
\end{proof}

\end{frame}

\subsection{frame 3}
\begin{frame}

\begin{theorem}
Let $D$ be the closed disk (i.e. $\{z : |z| \le |c|\}$), with $|c|>2$. Then the filled Julia set of $Q_c$ is given by
\begin{align*}
K_c = \bigcap\limits_{n\ge 0} Q_c^{\circ -n} (D)
\end{align*}
where $Q_c^{\circ -n} (D)$ denotes the preimage of $D$ under $Q_c^{\circ n}$
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    Consider the case where
    $z\notin \bigcap\limits_{n\ge 0} Q_c^{\circ -n} (D)$.
    Then there exists some $k\in \mathbb{N}$ such that $z\notin Q_c^{\circ -k} (D)$,
    so we have that $Q_c^{\circ k}(z) \notin D$. 
    Thus by the escape criterion, $z$ escapes to infinity under iteration
    of $Q_c$, so $z\notin K_c$.  

    Otherwise, if $z\in \bigcap\limits_{n\ge 0} Q_c^{\circ -n} (D)$, then 
     $Q_c^{\circ n}(z) \in D$ for all $n\in \mathbb{N}$. Thus $z$ is bounded under
     iteration of $Q_c$, so $z\in K_c$.
\end{proof}
